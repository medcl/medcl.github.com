    <p>Hi, there, I am a Developer and Evangelist at Elastic and the Elastic China Community creator. I have been using Elasticsearch for quite a long time(back to March 2010), I developed and maintaining some open source plugins for Elasticsearch. I joined Elastic in 2015, before that, I was on two startups and gathering over 7 years experience around backend engineering. my interests mainly around distributed system, search engine, devops, security and high performance.
In my spare time, I like to develop tools around elasticsearch and also like to talk about elasticsearch at the conferences or meetups.</p>

<p>Medcl [‘medikɔ:l], the unique name I created by myself, when I was young and during the first time when I learn English, I thought, hmm, I gotta to have a English name, and it should be cool, must not exist in the dictionary at all, so I picked 5 letters which looks good, and mix them together with some magic, that&rsquo;s it, and I use it as my avatar since then. (I will definitely not choose it if learned English well).</p>
